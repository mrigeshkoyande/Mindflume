### How the Bot Works

MindFlume uses a **keyword-matching engine**, not a machine-learning model.

1. User message is scanned for known keywords
2. Matching response is selected
3. If none match → fallback supportive response
4. Custom-trained phrases override defaults

---

### Pre-Trained Keywords

MindFlume’s local AI bot responds using a curated, human-centered keyword system. Each trigger maps to a calm, validating response and where helpful ,guides users toward an appropriate wellness tool.
